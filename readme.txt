This is the main readme file for the regbackup program.

This code was slapped together quickley as I needed to copy a users
registry in Windows 9X. There are loads of parts which could be updated
I do not have the time to do this. Please feel free to make any changes
you wish, and distruibute freely.

The program copies the REGISTRY files (SYSTEM.DAT and USER.DAT) into a
directory called C:\REGBACKUP, it saves it as system_ddmmyy.dat and user_ddmmyy.dat.
This needs to be created manually as the program does not and will bomb out if it is not there.


If you make any changes please let me know, just so that I know where
it is going... 

Thanks
